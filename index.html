        <h1> About Visual Studio Code</h1>
        <p>
            Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, built-in Gitcontrol, syntax highlighting,intelligent code replenishment, code fragments and code refactoring. It's also customizable so users can change the editor's theme, keyboard shortcuts, and preferences. It is free and open-source,although the official download is licensed.

            Visual Studio Code is based on Electron,a framework used to implement Node.jsapplications for the desktop and runs on the Blink layout engine. Although it uses the Electron framework, it does not use Atom and instead uses the same editor component used in Visual Studio Team Services.
